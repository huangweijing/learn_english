I woke up this morning and thought, "TGIF!". I have been looking forward to the
weekend, and all I need to do is to get through one more day of work. I drive to
work and pull into the parking lot next to my office building. I stop at the security gate. I put my
key card into the card reader, and the security arm goes up. I drive into
the parking structure and find a parking spot. I make sure that my parking
permit is showing in the windshield and I lock up. I get my briefcase out of the
back seat, and walk toward the building. It's a short walk and I'm there
in no time.
When I get there, I take out my badge and put it around my neck before I go
through the main entrance of the building. Employees are supposed to wear their badges at all times at work, so that the security guards know that we belong there. One day
last week, I forgot my badge at home, and I had to get a visitor's pass
for the day. My coworker made fun of me all day. He kept asking me if he could
get me some coffee and when I was leaving. What a joker!

我早上醒来想起“太好了，今天是周五！”。
我一直期待着周末，我所需要做的就是再熬过一个工作日。
我开车去上班，把车开进了办公室边上的停车场。
我停在了安检门口。
我把安检卡放入了读卡器后，安全手臂升起了。
我把车驶入了立体停车场，并找到了一个停车位。
我确认了我的停车许可证贴在挡风玻璃后，把车给锁上了。
我从车后座拿出了公文包，并走向了我的办公楼。
到办公室不用走很远的路，不一会儿我就到了那儿。
当我到那儿后，我拿出了自己的员工卡并在我通过建筑的正门前把它戴在了脖子上。
在工作期间的任何时候，员工们应该都佩戴着员工卡，因此保安知道我们属于那。
上周的某一天，我把员工卡忘在家了，然后我只能去拿了一张那天的参观者门卡。
我同事整天都在和开我玩笑。
他一直问我他是否能帮我冲些咖啡吗，我什么时候离开。
真是个爱开玩笑的人！
