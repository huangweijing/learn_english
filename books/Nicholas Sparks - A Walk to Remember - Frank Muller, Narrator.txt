Creator of New York Times best-seller, The Notebook, 
Nicholas Sparks touches readers’ deepest emotions with 
his spellbinding novels. This magical story, A Walk to 
Remember, tells of a truly unexpected love - one that 
changes a young man’s life forever.

Class of ’59 high school senior Landon Carter spends his 
time trying to stay out of trouble in the small town of 
Beaufort, North Carolina. The last person he’d ever fall 
for is quiet Jamie Sullivan, the Baptist minister’s daughter. 
But when he waits too long to get a date for the homecoming 
dance, she’s the only one left to ask. While his friends 
make jokes about the unlikely couple, he decides this will 
be their first and last date. But Jamie has a way of shaking 
up his plans, and Landon’s life goes down a path he never 
dreamed possible. 

A master storyteller, Nicholas Sparks transports you to a 
simpler time and place. You’ll find yourself smiling through 
your tears with Frank Muller’s heartwarming performance.
