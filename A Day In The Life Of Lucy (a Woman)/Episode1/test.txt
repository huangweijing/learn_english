My roomate thinks I am crazy, but doing this in the morning acually helps wake
up. I'm a night owl, not an early bird like she is, so I have to take an
extra minutes to get going in the morning.

Another reason for that is my bedroom and my bed is too comfortable. I

Another reason it's so hard to get up is because my bedroom and my bed are so comfortable.
I splurged and bought a bed with a very soft and thick mattress.


I have mathed sheets and pillowcase, and a comforter which is made by goose
down. Even my nightstand is matching with my sheets and the rest of my 
bedroom. I decorated it so that it's restful after a day at work.

When I get up, the first thing I do is to put on my robe. There is cold in the
apartment morning, whatever the time in a year. Then, I usually make bed. I
hated making bed when I was little. But it becomes a daily routine. Sometimes
though, I am so tired that I sleep in for a little long and then, definitely
the bed doesn't get made. In those days, I always wish I could sleep in all
day!
